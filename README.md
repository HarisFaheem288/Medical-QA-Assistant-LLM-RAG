# 🧠 LLM-Medical-QA-App (RAG + GPT-Neo)

A **Medical Question Answering Application** built using a **fine-tuned GPT-Neo model**, enhanced with **FAISS vector search** for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and deployed using **Streamlit**.

> ✅ Combines LLM + custom medical data + real-time QA interface

---

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Fine-tuned `GPT-Neo-125M` on custom medical text
- 🔎 Relevant document retrieval using `SentenceTransformer` + FAISS
- 📚 RAG pipeline: combine context + query for better answers
- 🌐 Interactive Streamlit web interface
- 💬 Accepts real-time user medical questions

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔧 Fine-Tuning
The GPT-Neo model is fine-tuned on domain-specific medical data (`data1.txt`) to adapt its generation style to medical Q&A.

### 📚 Vector Indexing (FAISS)
- The text is chunked into ~100-word segments.
- Each chunk is embedded using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (from Sentence Transformers).
- Embeddings are stored in a FAISS index for fast similarity search.

### 🔁 Retrieval-Augmented Generation
1. User enters a **medical question**.
2. App embeds the query and finds **most relevant chunks** using FAISS.
3. These chunks are added to the prompt.
4. Fine-tuned GPT-Neo generates the answer using the context.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. 🔽 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarisFaheem288/LLM-Medical-QA-App.git
cd LLM-Medical-QA-App
````

### 2. 🐍 Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Optional)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
```

### 3. 📦 Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. ▶️ Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the URL shown in your terminal (usually [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501))

## 🧪 Example

> **Question**: What are the common symptoms of diabetes?

> **Top Retrieved Chunks** (from medical dataset):

* Chunk 1: “Diabetes may lead to symptoms such as excessive thirst, frequent urination, and blurred vision...”
* Chunk 2: “Type 2 diabetes is often accompanied by fatigue, weight gain, and insulin resistance...”

> **Answer** (generated by GPT-Neo):
>
> > “Common symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue, and blurred vision.”
